## Game Concept: *Substratum*

### Premise
You are a human survivor living in a sealed underground facility known as the **Substratum**. The outside world is unknown, possibly hostile, and uninhabitable—at least for now. Your only means of exploration is through **robots** you design, build, and deploy from within your confined space.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Gather Resources**: Scavenge limited materials from within the Substratum.
2. **Build Robots**: Use resources to construct modular robots equipped with cameras, sensors, tools, and weapons.
3. **Explore**: Send robots to explore:
   - Inside the Substratum (abandoned sectors, tunnels)
   - Tunnels leading outward
   - The surface world
   - Aerial zones
   - Underwater environments
4. **Discover & Adapt**: Find new resources, blueprints, and environmental hazards.
5. **Upgrade**: Improve your robots and living conditions—but be careful. Connecting the outside world to your sealed environment can have **biological and atmospheric consequences**.
6. **Invent**: Engineer new components and systems through experimentation, not predefined recipes.

### Environments
- **Substratum Interior**: Safe but resource-scarce. Initial robot construction happens here.
- **Tunnels**: Procedurally generated, unstable, and rich in rare minerals. May connect to other Substrata.
- **Surface**: Hostile weather, radiation, and unknown lifeforms.
- **Aerial Zones**: Require advanced robotics and offer rare atmospheric elements.
- **Underwater**: High risk, high reward. Pressure and corrosion are key challenges.
- **Rivers & Flow Systems**: Robots must navigate dynamic water systems with current, erosion, and flooding mechanics.

### Procedural World Generation
- **Randomized Resource Distribution**: Each map has a unique layout of resources.
- **Local Minimums**: Some maps may lack key materials, forcing players to adapt or pursue alternate development paths.
- **Replayability**: No two playthroughs are the same. Players must strategize based on what the world gives them.

### Strategic Depth
- **Multiple Tech Trees**: Robotics, life support, environmental control, AI autonomy, propulsion, and weaponry.
- **Risk vs Reward**: Opening tunnels or airlocks may yield resources but risk contamination or health degradation.
- **Emergent Challenges**: Environmental anomalies, robot malfunctions, and ethical dilemmas.
- **Robot Battles**: Encounter hostile robots—either remnants of other Substrata or autonomous defense systems. Combat is tactical and physics-based.
- **Human Escape**: If enough resources and knowledge are gathered, the player may attempt to leave the Substratum—though survival outside is not guaranteed.

### Engineering & Invention System
- **Non-Deterministic Crafting**: Players can invent new components by combining materials and experimenting with configurations.
- **No Fixed Recipes**: There is no universal wiki or guaranteed outcome. Success depends on context, quality, and randomness.
- **Decay & Failure**: Components degrade over time. Some inventions may fail or behave unpredictably.
- **Simulation-Driven**: Systems are governed by physics, chemistry, and logic rather than hardcoded outcomes.

### Visual Style
Minimalist, atmospheric, and modular—think *Inside* meets *Factorio* with a touch of *Balatro*’s stylized UI.
